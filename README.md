### [Penetration Testing](./Projects/Penetration-Testing)
Detailed write-ups and walkthroughs of penetration testing engagements, including tools, techniques, and results.# Penetration Testing Projects

### [Project Name: Web Application Penetration Test](./WebApp-Pentest)
**Tools Used:** Kali Linux, Burp Suite, Metasploit, Nmap

**Description:**
In this project, I performed a penetration test on a web application to identify security vulnerabilities. The test was carried out in a controlled environment with permission from the client. I discovered several vulnerabilities including SQL injection and XSS, and I worked with the development team to remediate them.

### [Project Name: Network Penetration Test](./Network-Pentest)
**Tools Used:** Nmap, Wireshark, Nessus

**Description:**
This network penetration test involved scanning the client's internal network for potential vulnerabilities. The findings included unpatched devices and misconfigured firewalls. I provided recommendations to harden the network security posture.

### [Incident Response](./Projects/Incident-Response)
Case studies of security incidents, including detection, analysis, and response strategies.
# Incident Response Projects

### [Project Name: Malware Infection Response](./Malware-Infection-Response)
**Tools Used:** Splunk, VirusTotal, Volatility

**Description:**
I responded to an internal malware infection incident. After identifying the suspicious activity, I used forensic tools to analyze the malware's behavior and tracked down the root cause. The incident was contained, and I assisted in developing mitigation strategies to prevent future occurrences.

### [Capture The Flag Challenges](./Projects/Capture-The-Flag)
CTF challenges completed on platforms like Hack The Box, TryHackMe, etc., with detailed solutions.

### [Security Audits](./Projects/Security-Audits)
Reports on security audits I've performed, including findings, remediation recommendations, and tools used.
